SWF ファイルは、次のようなヘッダから始まります。

|フィールド|タイプ|内容|
| --- | --- | --- |
|シグネチャ|UI8|Signature byte:&br;“F” indicates uncompressed&br;“C” indicates compressed (SWF 6 and later only)|
|シグネチャ|UI8|Signature byte always “W”|
|シグネチャ|UI8|Signature byte always “S”|
|バージョン|UI8|Single byte file version (for example, 0x06 for SWF 6)|
|ファイルの長さ|UI32|Length of entire file in bytes|
|フレームサイズ|RECT|Frame size in twips|
|フレームレート|UI16|Frame delay in 8.8 fixed number of frames per second|
|フレーム数|UI16|Total number of frames in file|

The header begins with a three-byte signature of either 0x46, 0x57, 0x53 (“FWS”); or 0x43,
0x57, 0x53 (“CWS”). An FWS signature indicates an uncompressed SWF file; CWS
indicates that the entire file after the first 8 bytes (that is, after the FileLength field) was
compressed by using the ZLIB open standard. The data format that the ZLIB library uses is
described by Request for Comments (RFCs) documents 1950 to 1952. CWS file compression
is permitted in SWF 6 or later only.

A one-byte version number follows the signature. The version number is not an ASCII
character, but an 8-bit number. For example, for SWF 4, the version byte is 0x04, not the
ASCII character “4” (0x34).
The FileLength field is the total length of the SWF file, including the header. If this is an
uncompressed SWF file (FWS signature), the FileLength field should exactly match the file
size. If this is a compressed SWF file (CWS signature), the FileLength field indicates the total
length of the file after decompression, and thus generally does not match the file size. Having
the uncompressed size available can make the decompression process more efficient.
The FrameSize field defines the width and height of the on-screen display. This field is stored
as a RECT structure, meaning that its size may vary according to the number of bits needed
to encode the coordinates. The FrameSize RECT always has Xmin and Ymin value of 0; the
Xmax and Ymax members define the width and height (see “Using bit values” on page 16).
The FrameRate is the desired playback rate in frames per second. This rate is not guaranteed
if, for example, Flash Player is running on a slow or busy CPU.
The FrameCount is the total number of frames in this SWF file.


## SWF file structure [#g4d025fe]

Following the header is a series of tagged data blocks. All tags share a common format, so any
program parsing a SWF file can skip over blocks it does not understand. Data inside the block
can point to offsets within the block, but can never point to an offset in another block. This
ability enables tags to be removed, inserted, or modified by tools that process a SWF file.
The FileAttributes tag is only required for SWF 8 and later.
